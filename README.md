Ever had a shared folder of pictures with friends from one of your travels, and had a ton of weird filenames which made browsing pictures in order a hell?

This is a solution to that! Simply install this package and run a simple command to fix a selected folder by dedupe all pictures and renaming them using the yyyymmdd_HHMMss format.
